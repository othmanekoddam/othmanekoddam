- 👋 Hi, I’m @othmanekoddam
Othmane Koddam (O.K), moroccan |🇲🇦| 25 years old🧔🏻; ever since I was a little kid👶🏻, the computer world 🖥 has been my passion. I still remember sitting in front of computer in early age, playing games 🕹so happy & very curious about how it works. As I went through the BASIC tutorial📖, it was almost magic💫, being able to get the computer to do whatever I wanted, just by typing ⌨️in these funny little symbols, limited only by my own imagination and ingenuity🖼. Throughout middle and high school, I latched on to any ideas for projects I could get🔖, moving from "Hello World" all the way to a simple HTML/CSS website 🌅, with dozens of projects in between. I learned algorithms, then C, tearing through any books I could find on anything remotely related to software development & security breaches ♾. 

This passion carried me through my education at a computer engineering path💻. Here there were more resources 📚available to me than I ever could have imagined as a kid. I studied new languages📋, algorithms, compilers🤖, higher mathematics✍🏼, artificial inteligence🦾, all with pretty much the same fascination that drove me as a kid👦🏻. And it was here that I learned truly how much there was yet to learn.

So, now, in industry🏢, this passion remains with me. There's certainly yet more to learn🧐, yet more problems to solve🤔, and yet more to build👨🏻‍💻. And for this, I am very grateful🤲🏻.
